# Modeling-a-3-link-Robot
This is the youtube link to this project I made https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ6UTloXnIE
NOTE: Please read the paper that corresponds to this Project.
This project aims to model a 3 link robot in MATLAB graphic user interface. This is the first of a 3 series project where I combine both hardware and software together to create an intelligent robot.
